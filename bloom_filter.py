        the mmh3 Python package, which you may need to install using
        the command `pip3 install mmh3`. We take the hash value and mod
        it by our table size. This consistent hashing function doesn't rely on
        randomness, and will uniformly distribute a set of n inputs across m buckets
        (even with different values of m, the distribution of inputs will still be
        roughly uniform)

        Hint(s):
        1. Read the pseudocode provided!
        2. You will want to use self.hash(...).
        3. Remember we initialized our bit array to be of type
        boolean, so 1 should be represented as True, and 0 as 
        False.

        """
        :param x: The element to check whether or not it belongs
        to the bloom filter.
        :return: True or False; whether or not it is in the bloom filter.
        As described in the notes, this is not always accurate and may give
        false positives sometimes. That is, if this function returns False, 
        the element is definitely not in our structure, but if this function 
        returns True, the element may or may not be in our structure.

        Hint(s):
        1. Read the pseudocode provided!
        2. Again, remember we initialized our bit array to be of type
        boolean, so 1 should be represented as True, and 0 as 
        False.
