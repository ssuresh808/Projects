# ===================== ABOUT THE DATA ========================
# Inside the 'data' folder, the emails are separated into 'train'
# and 'test' data. Each of these folders has nested 'spam' and 'ham'
# folders, each of which has a collection of emails as txt files.
# You will only use the emails in the 'train' folder to train your
# classifier, and will evaluate on the 'test' folder.

# The emails we are using are a subset of the Enron Corpus,
# which is a set of real emails from employees at an energy
# company. The emails have a subject line and a body, both of
# which are 'tokenized' so that each unique word or bit of
# punctuation is separated by a space or newline. The starter
# code provides a function that takes a filename and returns a
# set of all of the distinct tokens in the file.

        Guidelines:
        1. Make sure to use the log-trick to avoid underflow.
        2. Make sure for Laplace smoothing you use +1 in numerator
        and +2 in denominator. This is even for words you haven't seen before
        in the training data, which would otherwise have 0 probability.
        3. Do not 'cheat' - meaning looking up the true label. We will
        test your code on a dataset you don't have access to. Remember,
        the goal is not 100% accuracy - a correct implementation will get
        exactly a certain accuracy.
        4. In case of a tie, predict 'self.HAM_LABEL'.
        5. Do NOT apply Laplace smoothing to P(ham) and P(spam).

        Hint(s):
        1. You may want to use the self.word_set function provided.
        2. Use np.log(...) to take logs.
        3. For a dictionary d, d[key] returns the value if the key exists.
        But if it doesn't, you get an error. To simplify your code,
        d.get(key, 0) will return d[key] if it exists, otherwise 0.
        4. You'll want to use the values you set during the fit function.
        Access those variables with a 'self' prefix, like self.num_train_hams.
